# Field_feelings ðŸ˜Š

Welcome to Field Feelings, a Streamlit-based application designed to support mental well-being by analyzing and responding to user emotions. This project leverages AI models to understand user sentiments, provide supportive feedback, and track emotional trends over time.

## Project Overview
Field Feelings aims to create a safe space where users can express their emotions and receive empathetic responses. The application identifies user sentiments based on chat history and provides tailored responses to help improve their mood.

## Features
* Sentiment Analysis: The application segments user emotions into predefined categories and visualizes the distribution of these sentiments.
* Conversational AI: Powered by Llama3.1 and integrated with Groq, the application responds to user inputs with supportive and constructive messages.
* Historical Data Tracking: Conversations and sentiments are saved and can be analyzed to understand emotional trends over time.
* Interactive Visualizations: Users can see how their feelings are distributed over time with dynamic charts.
